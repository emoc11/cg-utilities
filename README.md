## üí° Personal Project

This package is a showcase of my technical and creative approach to development.
Although accessible, it is not designed as a traditional community project,
but rather as a testament to my work and coding philosophy.

The goal is to share my methods and reflections while maintaining a clear
perspective on code usage and distribution.
